# landsat-metadata-txt-to-json


This code will open the landsat metadata TXT file, parse it line by line, and store the key-value pairs in a dictionary. It will then convert the dictionary and save it as JSON. 


Sample metadata TXT file of a landsat 8 image can be found in the file directory along with the output JSON file.
